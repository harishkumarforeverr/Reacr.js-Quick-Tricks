1) in Redux (Reducer)  --->  if we dont spread the previous state while updating any property in the State then all the remaning properties will be lost
2) in setState() ---> if we update only one property in the setState and dont speard the remaining property then it would not effect the another property
                            all will stay as it in the React State
3) in useState --->
