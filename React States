1) in Redux (Reducer)  --->  if we dont spread the previous state while updating any property in the State then all the remaning properties will be lost
2) in setState() ---> if we update only one property in the setState and dont speard the remaining property then it would not effect the another property
                            all will stay as it in the React State
3) in useState --->     Problem with UseState is if we dont speard the Previous values while Setting the State , then all the previous property will be gone/deleted and fresh property only be there
                            so Theme is while Upadte the State in the useState, we must/need to Spread all the previous property
